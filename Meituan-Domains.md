#  Representative business domains on the Meituan app

## Homepage Recommendation Domain
The homepage recommendation domain displays items in the form of a feed stream. Once users land on the Meituan homepage, they can see the recommended items directly without having to click anything.

## Search Domain
The search domain meets users' search requirements, delivering a list of items that match users' search keywords. Users can type in keywords in the search box located at the top of the Meituan app's homepage. After clicking the search button, they'll be directed to the item detail page which lists items related to their search terms.

For example, if a user types in 'starbucks' and clicks the search button, they'll be directed to the detail page for Starbucks items. Any orders placed on this detailed page would be considered as orders made through the search domain.

## Channel Section Domain
Every icon in the channel section domain signifies a different service offered by Meituan. Users can access the detailed page which lists items of the corresponding service by clicking on one of the icons. 

For example, if a user clicks on the "Discount Group Buy" icon in the channel section, they'll be directed to the detail page for discount group buy items. Any orders placed on this detailed page would be considered as orders made through the channel section domain.
